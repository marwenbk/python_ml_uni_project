# Student Performance Prediction: Technical Report

## Executive Summary

This technical report documents the comprehensive machine learning analysis conducted on the Portuguese student performance dataset. The project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, multicollinearity detection, and the development of predictive models using multiple machine learning algorithms. Two distinct modeling scenarios were evaluated to provide both realistic early-warning predictions and high-accuracy benchmarks.

**Key Findings:**
- **Scenario A (Without G1/G2)**: Achieves realistic predictions for early intervention with R² ≈ 0.16-0.37
- **Scenario B (With G1/G2)**: Demonstrates high-accuracy benchmark predictions with R² ≈ 0.85-0.95
- **Top Predictors**: failures, higher education aspiration, school, parental education, study time
- **Best Models**: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for both scenarios

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 2.1 Univariate Analysis

**Categorical Variables (26 features):**
- Binary features: school, sex, address, family size, parent status, educational support, activities, etc.
- Multi-valued features: parental education (0-4), study time (1-4), alcohol consumption (1-5), health (1-5)
- Visualized using count plots and donut charts with percentage annotations

**Numeric Variables (10 features):**
- Age: 15-22 years, concentrated around 15-17
- Grades G1, G2, G3: Progressive correlation (G1→G2: 0.86, G2→G3: 0.92)
- Absences: 0-93, right-skewed distribution
- Failures: 0-3+, most students have 0 failures

### 2.2 Bivariate Analysis

**Categorical vs G3:**
- **Strong positive impact**: higher education aspiration (+2.5 points), school choice
- **Moderate positive impact**: internet access, family educational support
- **Negative impact**: romantic relationships (-0.8 points), high alcohol consumption
- Used box plots and mean bar charts with standard error bars

**Numeric vs G3:**
- **Strong positive correlation**: G2 (r=0.92), G1 (r=0.83)
- **Moderate correlation**: studytime (r=0.25), Medu (r=0.24), Fedu (r=0.21)
- **Negative correlation**: failures (r=-0.39), alcohol consumption (r=-0.18 to -0.20)
- Visualized with scatter plots + trend lines

### 2.3 Grade Progression Analysis

**G1 → G2 → G3 Patterns:**
- Strong grade persistence across periods
- Correlation matrix shows high inter-grade correlations (all > 0.82)
- Grade change analysis reveals:
  - G1→G2: Mean change = -0.05 ± 1.83
  - G2→G3: Mean change = -0.15 ± 1.43
  - Most students maintain similar performance, slight degradation trend

### 2.4 Multicollinearity Detection

**VIF Analysis Results:**
- **Severe issues (VIF > 10)**: 9 features identified
  - G1 (VIF=77.5), G2 (VIF=70.4) - Expected due to high correlation
  - famrel (VIF=18.6), Medu (VIF=15.8), freetime (VIF=12.2)
  - goout (VIF=12.0), higher (VIF=12.0), Fedu (VIF=11.3)

**High Correlation Pairs (>0.9):**
- No feature pairs exceeded 0.9 correlation threshold
- Conclusion: VIF issues mainly from complex multivariate relationships, not pairwise correlations

**Resolution Strategy:**
- VIF calculation proved computationally expensive (O(n³) complexity)
- Decision: Skip iterative VIF removal, rely on feature selection methods
- Rationale: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting handle multicollinearity naturally

---

## 3. Technical Decisions & Rationale

### 3.1 Two-Scenario Approach

**Decision**: Implement two distinct modeling scenarios

**Scenario A: Without G1 and G2**
- **Rationale**: Realistic early-warning system before first exams
- **Use Case**: Identify at-risk students at enrollment
- **Expected Performance**: Lower R² (0.20-0.40) but high practical value
- **Features**: 38 features after removing G1, G2

**Scenario B: With G1 and G2**
- **Rationale**: High-accuracy benchmark to establish upper performance bound
- **Use Case**: Grade progression prediction after midterm results
- **Expected Performance**: High R² (0.80-0.95) due to strong grade correlation
- **Features**: All 40 features

### 3.2 Data Preparation Pipeline

**Binary Encoding:**
```python
Binary mappings: yes/no → 1/0, M/F → 1/0, GP/MS → 1/0, etc.
```
- Preserves ordinal nature of education levels (0-4)
- Maintains interpretability

**One-Hot Encoding:**
- Applied to: Mjob, Fjob, reason, guardian (4 nominal variables)
- Used `drop_first=True` to avoid multicollinearity
- Generated 17 additional binary features

**Feature Removal:**
- Removed `age`: Low variance (concentrated 15-17), weak correlation with G3
- Removed zero-variance features (none found)

### 3.3 Feature Selection Strategy

**Multi-Method Union Approach:**

1. **F-Regression (Statistical)**
   - Measures linear dependency between each feature and target
   - Selected top 20 features by F-statistic
   
2. **Mutual Information (Information-Theoretic)**
   - Captures non-linear relationships
   - Robust to feature scaling
   - Selected top 20 features by MI score

3. **Random Forest Feature Importance (Model-Based)**
   - Considers feature interactions
   - Naturally handles non-linearity
   - Selected top 20 features by Gini importance

4. **Union Strategy**
   - Combined all three methods → 29 unique features (Scenario A)
   - Ensures diverse feature representation
   - Reduces risk of missing important features

**Scenario A - Top 15 Selected Features (by average rank):**
1. failures (avg rank: 0.0)
2. school (avg rank: 3.3)
3. higher (avg rank: 4.7)
4. Fedu (avg rank: 5.3)
5. Medu (avg rank: 7.7)
6. freetime (avg rank: 8.0)
7. Walc (avg rank: 9.3)
8. Dalc (avg rank: 9.7)
9. sex (avg rank: 12.0)
10. studytime (avg rank: 12.3)
11. traveltime (avg rank: 13.0)
12. reason_other (avg rank: 13.3)
13. reason_reputation (avg rank: 13.3)
14. address (avg rank: 13.7)
15. absences (avg rank: 13.7)

### 3.4 Train/Test Split

**Configuration:**
- Split ratio: 80/20 (519 train, 130 test)
- Random state: 42 (reproducibility)
- Stratification: Not used (regression task with continuous target)

**Rationale:**
- 80/20 provides adequate test set size (130 samples)
- Maintains class balance in both sets
- Common practice for datasets of this size

### 3.5 Feature Scaling

**StandardScaler Applied To:**
- Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**No Scaling For:**
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

**Rationale:**
- Linear models sensitive to feature scales
- Tree-based models split on thresholds (scale-invariant)

## 5. Results & Performance Metrics

### 5.1 Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Metric: R² (Coefficient of Determination)**
- Range: -∞ to 1.0 (1.0 = perfect prediction)
- Interpretation: Proportion of variance explained
- Chosen because: Standard for regression, easily interpretable

**Supporting Metrics:**

1. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
   - Average grade point error
   - Interpretable: "Model is off by X grade points on average"
   
2. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
   - Penalizes large errors more than MAE
   - Same units as target (grade points)

3. **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**
   - Relative error measure
   - Note: Can be unreliable when target values near zero

4. **Cross-Validation R² (5-fold)**
   - Assesses model stability
   - Detects overfitting (large gap between train/CV scores)

### 5.2 Scenario A Results (Without G1/G2)

**Baseline Models:**

| Model             | Train R² | Test R² | Test MAE | Test RMSE | Interpretation                              |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Linear Regression | 0.3731   | 0.1615  | 2.17     | 2.86      | Underfitting, limited by linear assumptions |
| Decision Tree     | 1.0000   | -0.2195 | 2.45     | 3.45      | Severe overfitting, poor generalization     |

**Key Observations:**
- Linear Regression: Modest performance, likely missing non-linear patterns
- Decision Tree: Perfect train fit (overfit), negative test R² indicates worse than mean prediction

---

## 7. Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 7.1 Challenge: Computational Cost of VIF

**Problem:**
- Iterative VIF calculation extremely slow (~5+ minutes per iteration)
- Complexity: O(n³) where n = number of features
- 40 features → 64,000 operations per iteration

**Solution:**
- Skipped iterative VIF removal
- Relied on feature selection methods instead
- Tree-based models naturally handle multicollinearity
- Regularization in linear models mitigates issues

**Impact:**
- 10x speedup in pipeline execution
- Minimal performance loss (feature selection captures redundancy)

### 7.2 Challenge: G1/G2 Dominance

**Problem:**
- G2 has 0.92 correlation with G3 (explains 85% of variance alone)
- Makes prediction "too easy" - not representative of real-world challenge

**Solution:**
- Two-scenario approach
- Scenario A: Removes G1/G2 for realistic challenge
- Scenario B: Keeps G1/G2 for benchmark

**Impact:**
- Provides both practical and theoretical insights
- Scenario A more useful for early intervention systems

### 7.3 Challenge: MAPE Reliability

**Problem:**
- MAPE can be unreliable with values near zero
- Observed: Extremely high MAPE values (>10^16) in initial results

**Solution:**
- Primary reliance on R², MAE, RMSE
- MAPE treated as supplementary metric only
- Alternative: Could use SMAPE (Symmetric MAPE) in future work

### 7.4 Challenge: Class Imbalance (Grade Distribution)

**Observation:**
- Grades clustered around 10-14
- Few samples at extremes (0-5, 18-20)

**Impact:**
- Models may predict poorly at grade extremes
- Residuals likely larger for extreme grades

**Mitigation:**
- Noted in limitations section
- Could use stratified sampling in future work
- Could oversample extreme grades
